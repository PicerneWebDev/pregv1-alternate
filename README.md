- Never make direct changes to the Master Branch. If you would like to contribute changes, updates, bug fixes, etc. you must fork your own repo and submit a Pull request.
- Setting up a website using this theme should only require changes to the PREG.LESS file in the /assets/less directory
- If you receive a help ticket regarding a bug with a website using this theme make sure to properly submit a bug via GitHub. If you attempt to fix the bug do so via your own fork and provide screenshots of a working local installation.
- Follow all instructions in order to properly install this theme. Make sure that all plugins are installed and configured prior to editing the LESS files for the website.

Requirements:
------------
In order to customize your iteration of your theme you will need to have a LESS compiler installed on your workstation. If you are using a Windows Machine you can install [WinLess](http://winless.org/). If you are a Mac User download the LESS compiler that you are most comfortable with.
